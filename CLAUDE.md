# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a personal blog built with Hugo static site generator, hosted at https://blog.kelvin.ma/. The blog uses the hugo-coder theme and is designed for a friendly, casual writing tone focused on tech learnings, OMSCS course summaries, book notes, and AI/finance/tech insights.

## Development Commands

Don't start the server yourself. It's always running and the url is http://localhost:1313/.

### Local Development
```bash
# Start development server with draft posts
hugo server -D

# Start development server without drafts
hugo server
```

### Content Management
```bash
# Create a new blog post
hugo new content posts/<post-name>.md

# Example: hugo new content posts/my-new-post.md
```

### Building
```bash
# Build the site for production
hugo

# Output will be in the public/ directory
```

## Architecture & Structure

### Key Directories
- `content/posts/` - Blog post markdown files
- `content/notes/` - Blog post notes and research for Claude Code reference
- `layouts/` - Custom layout overrides (notably custom homepage layout)
- `static/` - Static assets (images, CSS, etc.)
- `themes/hugo-coder/` - Hugo Coder theme submodule
- `public/` - Generated site output (ignored in git) - DO NOT MODIFY

### Theme Customizations
- **Custom Homepage Layout**: `layouts/index.html` creates a two-column layout with the most recent post on the left (2/3 width) and a sidebar list of recent posts on the right (1/3 width)
- **Theme**: Uses hugo-coder theme with minimal customization
- **Content Type**: Posts are stored in `content/posts/` and use the "posts" content type

### Content Format
- Posts use TOML front matter (`+++` delimited)
- Standard fields: `title`, `date`, `draft`
- New posts are created as drafts by default (archetype in `archetypes/default.md`)
- Content is written in Markdown

### Site Configuration
- **Config File**: `hugo.toml` (TOML format)
- **Base URL**: https://blog.kelvin.ma/
- **Theme**: hugo-coder
- **Pagination**: 20 posts per page
- **Taxonomies**: categories, tags, series

## Content Guidelines

### Writing Style
- Friendly, casual tone
- Focus areas: OMSCS courses, tech learnings, book notes, AI/finance/tech insights
- Markdown format with occasional images
- Keep posts accessible and conversational

### Post Creation Workflow
1. Create new post: `hugo new content posts/<post-name>.md`
2. Edit the post content and front matter
3. Set `draft = false` when ready to publish
4. Test locally with `hugo server -D`
5. Build with `hugo` when ready for production

## Important Notes

- **DO NOT MODIFY**: Never modify files in the `public/` directory - these are generated by Hugo
- **DO NOT ACCESS**: Never read, write, or interact with the `public/` directory in any way - it contains generated files only
- **Notes Directory**: Use `content/notes/` for blog post research and notes that Claude Code can reference

## Deployment

The site appears to be deployed via Cloudflare Pages. The `public/` directory contains the built site and should be deployed to the hosting provider.
