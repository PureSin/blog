      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard it a million times by now: AI is changing everything, especially when it comes to writing software. Tools like smart autocomplete, AI chats, and now the Gemini CLI are making it way easier to code. I&amp;rsquo;ve definitely seen this myself. I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to whip up small, single-use scripts in no time.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m taking a bit of a break from work right nowâ€”a self-made sabbatical, you could call it.</description>

      <description>A new blog comes alive Link to heading A few years ago, I used to blog on Medium.
