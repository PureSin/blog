      <description>Pocket is a service for saving links for later reading. It shuts down tomorrow, July 8th RIP. Inspired by noperator&amp;rsquo;s post, I decided to use Claude Code to analyze my exports as well.&#xA;First some basic facts about my Pocket archive: 1,530 articles saved between January 2020 and May 2025. That&amp;rsquo;s about 306 articles per year, or roughly 6 articles per week. Not too shabby when I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m always behind on my reading backlog.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard it a million times by now: AI is changing everything, especially when it comes to writing software. Tools like smart autocomplete, AI chats, and now the Gemini CLI are making it way easier to code. I&amp;rsquo;ve definitely seen this myself. I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to whip up small, single-use scripts in no time.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m taking a bit of a break from work right nowâ€”a self-made sabbatical, you could call it.</description>

      <description>Intro/Background Link to heading A few weeks back I attended the PearVC X OpenAI hackathon in SF.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s the first in-person external hackathon I attended in years, and the first in the &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo; era. Want to write done some thoughts on how &amp;ldquo;hacking&amp;rdquo; a product has been impacted by AI.&#xA;The Hackathon Link to heading The event took place in PearVC&amp;rsquo;s incubator space in Mission Bay. Had a nice view of the city on a beautiful day.</description>

      <description>A new blog comes alive Link to heading A few years ago, I used to blog on Medium. That was paused during COVID, but now I&amp;rsquo;m resuming the blogging effort here with a self-hosted version using the Hugo framework and Cloudflare Pages for serving.&#xA;The main reason for this change is to have long-term control over my content and to use Git for version control. I don&amp;rsquo;t plan for this blog to be much more sophisticated in style than markdown with occasional images.</description>
