Gemini CLI vs Claude Code 

# Pricing:

Use a Gemini API key:
The Gemini API provides a free tier with 100 requests per day using Gemini 2.5 Pro, control over which model you use, and access to higher rate limits (with a paid plan).

No ability to see costs (just token usage)

Claude Code:

"Free" with a plan (rate limited) and limited model based on tier. 

/cost shows the cost (if no plan) otherwise use https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage
