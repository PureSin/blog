You've probably heard it a million times by now: AI is changing everything, especially when it comes to writing software. Tools like smart autocomplete, AI chats, and now the Gemini CLI are making it way easier to code. I've definitely seen this myself. I've been able to whip up small, single-use scripts in no time.

I'm taking a bit of a break from work right nowâ€”a self-made sabbatical, you could call it. It's giving me time to look at my daily life and see where I can use tech to make things a little smoother. I've noticed a few things:

*   **Repetitive stuff:** Like dealing with my inbox or endlessly scrolling social media.
*   **Apps that are *almost* right:** I use a lot of apps and websites that are good, but not quite perfect for me.
*   **"Should I keep this?" subscriptions:** You know the ones.

So, I'm thinking, with these new AI tools, maybe I can just build my own software to handle all this. Stuff that's tailored exactly to what I need, especially now that it's so much cheaper and easier to build and maintain.

To get started, I'm going to tackle a classic project: a simple timer app. It'll guide me through a series of activities, but the twist is that I can easily change up the activities and times just by editing a config file. This feels like a good first step on my quest to build my own set of personal software.
