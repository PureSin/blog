# A new blog comes alive

A few years ago, I used to blog on [Medium](https://kelvinma.medium.com/). That was paused during COVID, but now I'm resuming the blogging effort here with a self-hosted version using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework and Cloudflare Pages for serving.

The main reason for this change is to have long-term control over my content and to use Git for version control. I don't plan for this blog to be much more sophisticated in style than markdown with occasional images.

The focus of this blog will be a mix of:

- Summaries of each OMSCS course as I complete them
- Random learnings, mostly tech-focused
- Notes from books
- Educated guesses on AI, finance, and tech

Here's to a new beginning.
